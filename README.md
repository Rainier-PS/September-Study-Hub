# September Study Hub

> If September was a GUI app, it would feel like a quiet autumn afternoon, cozy, creative, and comforting.

## Overview
**September Study Hub** is a cozy productivity application designed to help users manage their study routines in a warm September-themed environment. It combines several study tools into one desktop app, built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Electron**.

You can use it either:
- As a **web app** (open `index.html` in your browser), or  
- As a **desktop app** (Windows installer provided).

> September Study Hub is my way of turning the calm, focused energy of September into an app, a place where productivity feels warm and approachable.
